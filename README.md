The command npm i express nodemon mongoose jsonwebtoken crypto-js installs several Node.js packages. Here's what each of them does:

express: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests and responses.

nodemon: A development tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application when file changes are detected. It improves the development workflow by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the server after every change.

mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model your MongoDB data, ensuring that it follows a specific structure and simplifying interactions with the database through easy-to-use APIs.

jsonwebtoken: A package for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. They allow secure data transmission between parties as JSON objects.

crypto-js: A library that provides cryptographic algorithms like hashing, encryption, and decryption. It's used for securely handling sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or other confidential information.

In summary, these packages together enable you to build a secure, modern web application with MongoDB (using Mongoose), handle user authentication (using JWT), automatically restart the server during development (with Nodemon), and handle cryptography (with CryptoJS).
